    <h2>Hola! visitors</h2>
    <p class=abt>
        I am JOEY KING, born in 1999 and acting since the age of 4.
        <br>
        I got my first movie, Grace, when I was only 6 years old and have since starred in TV shows like Bent and Fargo.
        <br>
        I come from a long line of actors, including my grandmother, who was a live-theater actress. Plus, my two older sisters, Hunter King and Kelli King, are also actresses. Guess, the passion must run in my genes...:D
        <br>
        I have also appeared in the films Battle: Los Angeles (2011), Crazy, Stupid, Love (2011), The Dark Knight Rises (2012), Oz the Great and Powerful (2013), The Conjuring (2013), White House Down (2013), Independence Day: Resurgence (2016), Wish Upon (2017), Slender Man (2018), and The Lie (2018).
        <br>I gained wider recognition for my lead role in The Kissing Booth (2018) and its sequel. I received critical acclaim for my starring role in the crime drama series The Act (2019), for which I was nominated for both a Primetime Emmy Award and Golden Globe Award.
